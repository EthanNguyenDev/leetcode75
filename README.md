# Practice Plan for "LeetCode75" and "Grokking Coding Interview Patterns in Java"

This repository is dedicated to solving the [LeetCode 75](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/) and [Grokking Coding Interview Patterns in Java](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-coding-interview-patterns-java) problem 
collection to enhance my programming skills and problem-solving abilities. Each problem solution is implemented in 
Java and organized in pattern packages within this repository.

## Structure
Below is a table listing the problems along with links to the corresponding Java files and the original LeetCode problem URLs:

| Problem Pattern  | Problem Name                       | Java Solution File                                                                                     | LeetCode URL |
