# Practice Plan for "LeetCode75" and "Grokking Coding Interview Patterns in Java"

This repository is dedicated to solving the [LeetCode 75](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/) and [Grokking Coding Interview Patterns in Java](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-coding-interview-patterns-java) problem 
collection to enhance my programming skills and problem-solving abilities. Each problem solution is implemented in 
Java and organized in pattern packages within this repository.

## Structure
Below is a table listing the problems along with links to the corresponding Java files and the original LeetCode problem URLs:

| Problem Pattern | Problem Name                 | Java Solution File                                                                  | LeetCode URL |
|-----------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Graphs - DFS    | Keys and Rooms | [KeyAndRoom.java](./src/leetcode/seventyfive/graph/dfs/KeyAndRoom.java)             | [keys-and-rooms](https://leetcode.com/problems/keys-and-rooms/) |
| Graphs - DFS    | Number of Provinces | [NumberOfProvince.java](./src/leetcode/seventyfive/graph/dfs/NumberOfProvince.java) | [number-of-provinces](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/) |
| Two Pointer     | MoveZero | [MoveZero.java](./src/leetcode/seventyfive/twopointer/MoveZero.java) | [move-zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/) |
| ...             | ...                          | ...                                                                                 | ... |

## Goal
- Solve one LeetCode problem every day.
- Track my progress and measure improvement over time.

Happy coding!
